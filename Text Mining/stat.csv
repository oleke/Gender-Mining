As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to me. She was my so called ""best friend"". I stared at her long, silky hair, and wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before and handed them to her. She said ""thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

11th grade
The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears, mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me, said ""thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Senior year
The day before prom she walked to my locker. My date is sick"" she said; he's not going to go well, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates, we would go together just as ""best friends"". So we did. Prom night, after everything was over, I was standing at her front door step. I stared at her as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but she isn't think of me like that, and I know it. Then she said ""I had the best time, thanks!"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Graduation Day
A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before I could blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and cried as I hugged her. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder and said, ""you're my best friend, thanks"" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

A Few Years Later
Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting married now. I watched her say ""I do"" and drive off to her new life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't see me like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away, she came to me and said ""you came!"". She said ""thanks"" and kissed me on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

Funeral
Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my ""best friend"". At the service, they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years. This is what it read: I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesn't notice me like that, and I know it. I want to tell him, I want him to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love him but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.

“Always know that there is unlimited power in a developed mind and a disciplined spirit. If your mind can conceive it and your heart can believe it, you can achieve it. Suffering breeds character; character breeds faith, and in the end, faith will prevail. Armed with this knowledge and a faith in GOD, you can turn minuses into pluses; you can turn stumbling blocks into stepping-stones. It is tough, but your trials will serve to make you strong. Though your enemies will try to break your spirit, you are not the hole in the donut, my son; you are the gold in the ghetto. Keep polishing, keep shining that gold, and you will be light in the darkness and heat in cold places. But what’s more, you will be a man with integrity, my son.” Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. – 1993

The flesh is democracy
And I see it coming

But you have to open
up yourself to the flesh
Because you will recieve
Help and blessings abondantly
They bones are the whole
house Of Nigeria,Our bones
are dry We are cut off and
Hopes are being lost
But God said I will open
Your grave and save you
And course you to come out
Bring you to the land Nigeria""
Anele E. Obasih




“Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, weakened by my soulful cries. Does my haughtiness offend you? Don’t you take it awful hard, ‘cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines diggin’ in my own back yard. You may shoot me with your words, you may cut me with your eyes, you may kill me with your hatefulness, but still, like air, I’ll rise.” - Maya Angelou

""Everyone says love hurts, but that isn’t true. Loneliness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love, but in reality, love is the only thing in this world that covers up all pain and makes someone feel wonderful again. Love is the only thing in this world that does not hurt."" Meagan Ramirez♥♥

""worship is recognizing God for who He is; it is ascribing worth to Him; it is God's people telling Him about the worth they see in Him. In fact, worship could very well be thought of as 'worth-ship.''

""Do not give up in life because there are lot of difficulties.

Difficulties in your life do not come to destroy you;
but to help you realize your hidden potential.""

Let difficulties know that you are difficult.

""The road to success is not straight. There is a curve called Failure, a loop called Confusion, speed bumps called Friends, red lights called Enemies, caution lights called Family. You will have flats called Jobs. But, if you have a spare called Determination, an engine called Perseverance, insurance called Faith, you will make it to a place called Success""
""A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it to you when you have forgotten the words""
“No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow.”
- Alice Walker

A woman’s heart should be so hidden in Christ, that a man should have to seek Him first to find her.” Maya Angelou

The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him.-Ralph Waldo Emerson
'For the woman whose heart is truly hidden in Christ is favored to receive a man seeking after God’s heart in all his ways – including finding her.''


""But we must be prepared to realize that we will not “fit in” by the world’s standards. This quest for a hidden heart in Christ results in a set apart lifestyle that is lived differently than those who are in the world. We don’t (shouldn’t) act, dress, talk, or behave like the world, because we don’t seek the things the world seeks. We seek that which is above – that is Jesus our Lord and the virtues He bestows.""

""Does everybody know that u are a christian by your action or does everybody think u are a christian because u are acting?""-poetry

""I dont know which one is worst- Nobody knows i'm a Christian or the only ones that know are the people at my church.""- Poetry


Suceess is 10 percent inspiration and 90 percent perspiration- Albert Eistein

""I in Him..Him in Me""

""who is he that saith when the Lord has not commanded it""
""It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes...All nations compassed me about, in the name of Jesus I will destroy them""

""You Have to Take the Good with the Bad, Smile with the Sad,
Love what You've got and Remember what you Had. Always Forgive, but Never Forget, Learn from your Mistakes, but Never Regret. People Change,Things go Wrong, but Just Remember, Life Goes on.""
